Inventory Management System Made during ETG Internship

The Inventory Management System made helps to keep track of the product purchased and maintain a sales record.
It allows addition and removal of products into/from the inventory. The Products have been classified through their unique product IDs. The product features include product ID, Product Name, Price, Available Stock in inventory, Product Type/Variety and a label indicating whether a product is under the 'Buy 1 Get 1 Scheme'.
On purchase of even number of items the user pays the amount equal to the floor of the quantity purchased + 1 as one item won't be eligible for the scheme. 
Thus, making the updation process inteliigent and easy to use.
On sales, the inventory is updated with the current stock available.
If the product quantity asked for is more than what is available or the product variety demanded is unavailable, the user/consumer gets a message that there's an inadequate supply of the product.
